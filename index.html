                    <h4>My journey as a developer</h4>
                    <p>A few months ago I decided to learn about web-development and during my quest for knowledge, I stumbled upon the Power Learn Project.</p>
                    <p> I applied and got into the program. My journey through the program has been exciting to say the least. The constant learning and the challenges in the form of hackathons and assignments have given me the opportunity to put my skills to the test. I am committed to this journey and plan to use what I learn to better the community around me by providing solutions through technology and of course try to earn a living from it.</p>
                    <p>Follow along as I deep dive into the world of programming!</p>
